## I would be lying if I said that I got here on my own.

The most interesting questions I've gotten throughout my interview processes have been the ones regarding my journey to where I am today. One of the questions that sparked memories a decade deep was in regards to how I chosen my alma mater, and what had inspired me to pursue a degree in graphic design. Although I had been interested in building websites from the age of 12, the thought of becoming a graphic designer had never crossed my mind as a pathway to web design it came time to choose a degree. This had changed after I had met my best friend's girlfriend, [Beth Steffel](http://www.bethsteffel.com/), a senior studying graphic design at the University of Akron.

## You may be a mentor without knowing it

Beth was easy to talk to, and we shared similar taste in art and design. I'd spend time at her apartment, peppering her with questions, leafing through her books, and getting miniature lessons in design. Although we became good friends, I consider Beth my first mentor. Her patience, support, and encouragement led me to follow in her footsteps and accept an offer to join the Myers School of Art with a focus on graphic design, an invaluable decision for my career path.

## Being a mentee requires time and focus

Throughout college, I had exposure to many talented professors that taught us invaluable lessons in design, but I didn't form tight mentorship relationships with any of them. Looking back, I don't think it was the fault of the school or the professors, but more-so my situation. I supported myself throughout school, and would dash off from class to my various jobs, working 30 or more hours a week. I didn't have the time to focus on becoming the best designer that I could be, my focus was survival.

Over the years, I have found that the best mentorship situations arise when both parties take time to foster the relationship. Taking the time to ask well-formed questions, asking for actionable feedback, and constantly working towards improvement are the best ways to utilize the time of someone that has offered to help you.

## The characteristics of a good mentor

When I wanted to try my hand at organic farming, I lived in a community of many smart, experienced farmers. They offered advice, support, and positions ranging from field hand to farm manager. Each of the farmers I worked with were mentors to me. They answered my questions with patience, they were interested in my progress and experiments, and they taught me through conversations and first-hand experience about agriculture, biology, animal husbandry, and human relationships.

Mentors are interested in helping you find the answers to your questions. They may not know everything you are asking about,
