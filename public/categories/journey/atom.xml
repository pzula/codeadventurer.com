    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>56 days from now, 26 students from gSchool will be closing their laptops, saying their goodbyes, and getting ready to start their careers as software developers. Some of them will be staying in Denver, some will be joining past graduates of the program built by Jumpstart Lab, and others will be spreading out across the country, working at startups, consultancies, and corporations. Regardless of where they end up, the six months they spent together will never be forgotten. The shared wins and frustrations, the walking taco days and lunchtime dip parties, and plenty of post-project-deadline happy hours have built solid friendships that are sure to last the test of time.</p>

<p>Before that day comes, I still have work to do. As I&rsquo;m reading Sandi Metz&rsquo;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388765519&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=practical+object-oriented+design+in+ruby">Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby</a>, I see that I can improve on the way I think about and execute the design of applications. I&rsquo;m excited to work through the book, and apply the lessons in my projects.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also attending <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash</a> this upcoming week and will begin looking for companies where I would make a good fit. I&rsquo;m planning on returning to Ohio after graduation, and would like to see what sort of opportunities are available. Thanks to my instructors, I already have a few connections to meet with next week to discuss the job climate in the Cleveland area. I&rsquo;m excited to talk to them and get to know other Rubyists in Ohio.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m at CodeMash, I&rsquo;ll be missing work time on our current project, FeedEngine, which is all about APIs. I&rsquo;ll be doing my best to communicate with my group, and contribute where I can without interfering with the overall progress. It will be interesting to see if I can integrate lessons from the conference into the project as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also excited for our upcoming project focused on Service-Oriented Architecture, and finally our Mastery project. I received some fun hardware for Christmas and hope to use it in my final project to integrate my passion for technology with my passion for agriculture.</p>

<p>On a final note, my mentor, Matt Rogers, has been a tremendous resource. His help and understanding has really helped me grow as a developer. I applaud his ability to find relevant open-source work to help explain new concepts, or reinforce the ones I did not understand well. He has been diligent in following along the curriculum, asking me about the projects I am working on, and helping me understand where improvements can be made. I am very grateful for his time and his passion for mentoring. Without his help, I wouldn&rsquo;t have made as much learning progress in the last project as I had. Thank you, Matt!</p>

    <id>http://codeadventurer.com/2013/12/06/halfway-home</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week marked the halfway point for gSchool. We had our second assessments, using the instructions from the <a href="https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/academy/workshops/scrabble_intermediate.markdown">Intermediate Scrabble</a> repo and requirements. <!-- more -->It was a fun challenge, and I&rsquo;ve had some major improvement since the previous assessment. After our assessments, we worked on a Rails tutorial that introduced some more advanced concepts. On Tuesday, the rest of the class worked on Arduino projects, but I had to catch a flight home for the holiday and missed out on that particular hack day. (But I got a few fun things from <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com">Sparkfun</a> on sale that I&rsquo;m going to hack on over Christmas). It felt great to go home for a few days, spend time with family, sleep in my bed, and program for only four hours instead of all day.</p>

<p>This week we got back at it in full force. We&rsquo;re working on <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/fourth_meal.html#functional-requirements">Fourth Meal</a>, building upon Dinner Dash using a codebase that is different from the last project. My group chose the project I worked on last time, which I am grateful for, because I did not feel I understood all of the parts of it before. We started out by refactoring a few pieces of the code, exploring the implementations, deploying a staging and production site, and writing our user stories in <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/968652">Pivotal Tracker</a>. We&rsquo;ve been focused on writing proper user stories, understanding our iterations, and dealing with a &ldquo;real&rdquo; client (&ldquo;real&rdquo; meaning Jeff Casimir, acting (in good character)  a demanding client). Our project includes expanding the original codebase to support multi-tenancy (i.e. multiple restaurants in the system with the ability to shop between them independently). I&rsquo;m enjoying the focus on iterations, and sticking to user stories throughout the development process. I believe it&rsquo;s important to delivering value as quickly as possible in an agile way.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we also started a small side project with <a href="http://yacenter.org/">Young Entrepreneurs</a> to help a group of kids launch their online presence for the small businesses they are working on. We have a different group in this project than for Fourth Meal, and are primarily working on design and listening to client needs. Our clients are two young girls (age 7 and 11) that have launched their own body care products line. They are very excited about their products, and it amazes me at how professional they acted for their ages. We had a great brainstorming session with them, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to sharing our ideas and wireframes with them next week for their input.</p>

<p>Halfway through the course, I&rsquo;m feeling excited about my progress and the ways I&rsquo;ve grown along the way. I&rsquo;m excited to see where I stand at the end of the course, and how I continue to progress at my first job out of gSchool. I feel that my ability to collaborate with other developers has vastly improved. Prior to gSchool, I was always a lone coder &mdash; this was not by choice, but due to the work styles of the previous workplaces. I&rsquo;m starting to get better at articulating my thoughts verbally during pair programming sessions, explaining why something makes sense in my head without taking over someone&rsquo;s keyboard, and articulating when I&rsquo;m stuck on a piece of functionality and the thought process behind what I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish and the things I&rsquo;ve already tried that didn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to continue working on Fourth Meal with my group members, and seeing where we can take this project by the deadline. It will be interesting to see if we have estimated our iterations correctly, and to see if keeping a close eye on Tracker will help us reach our goals and deliver a great final product.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, we finished up our Dinner Dash project in Rails. It was a great first dive into Rails, and I had a lot of fun learning about ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, and all of the helper methods. <!-- more --> One of the biggest things I learned as we were wrapping up the project and working through our user interface is that in order to do BDD effectively, a project really needs to start off with wireframes. In the last two projects where I have used BDD, it&rsquo;s been a little rough connecting the user interface up in a logical way at the end. It makes much more sense to work through it at the beginning to help guide the final development and make design an easier piece of the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dinner_dash.png" title="Platable" alt="Platable" />
<a href="http://platable.herokuapp.com">(See Platable on Heroku)</a></p>

<p>At the end of last week, we had our second code retreat. We worked through a few 50-minute sessions to build <a href="https://github.com/JumpstartLab/code_retreat">Battleship</a> under different constraints. Unlike our last code retreat, where the scope was much smaller and tests were provided to help guide the design of the API, this time there were only instructions of how the gameplay works. Although the problem is very interesting, it was frustrating to keep switching the context of which piece of the game we were building, and it did not seem like any of my pairs and I got remotely close to solving the piece at hand before we had to delete our code and start over on a new part of the game. However, the exercise has definitely piqued my interest, and I plan on revisiting Battleship on my own to try to build it as a CLI.</p>

<p>This week. we&rsquo;ve been working on JavaScript. It&rsquo;s been great to see how you can test JavaScript using Jasmine, and I&rsquo;ve started to fill in some of the holes in my previous JavaScript knowledge. The best part of the week when we went back to our Dinner Dash projects and started integrating the things we had learned into our projects by updating our cart data with ajax, generating JSON with Rails, and giving live feedback to users purchasing products. The changes we started to implement really began to make the projects shine, and made them feel more like modern web applications.</p>

<p>Overall, on the next project, I&rsquo;d like to integrate more wire framing, a more thought-out user interface, and a bit more of JavaScript to make the project feel more solid.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Dashing Down the Rails]]></title>
    <link href="http://codeadventurer.com/2013/11/08/dashing-down-the-rails"/>
    <updated>2013-11-08T10:13:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://codeadventurer.com/2013/11/08/dashing-down-the-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to look back on my time here at gSchool and realize that at this point in time, if I were in a shorter bootcamp program, I&rsquo;d be graduating today. <!-- more --> Instead, I&rsquo;m midway through my first Rails project, and learning about all of the features that Rails implements for me through a well-thought-out Ruby backend. When I want to write my own validators or database searches, I start down that journey, but then quickly realize that Rails has already taken care of it for me and that I just need to find the right method in the documentation.</p>

<p>I can imagine what a contrast this is for people who learn as little Ruby as possible in order to get by using all the magic that Rails provides. I think that if I didn&rsquo;t know about the internals of how it worked, I would likely end up in the same boat as when I was hacking things together in Drupal. I have often heard that it is best to know Ruby before working with Rails, and now having experience with both Ruby, and Sinatra, I can see the differences between what Rails provides, and what the language itself does for me, which I think is very important for anyone using any framework.</p>

<p>Our current project is called <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/dinner_dash.html">Dinner Dash</a>, and the task at hand is to build an online ordering system for a restaurant. My group has been working with MiniTest, RackTest &amp; Capybara to use a BDD-style approach to the project, and we have also been using PivotalTracker to track our progress, combined with <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git flow</a> to keep ourselves organized. My mentor works for PivotalLabs, and was very helpful in giving me a few more tips on how to use PivotalTracker to map through our user stories and scheduling our work and expectations.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this project, I was having a hard time mapping my prior knowledge of SQL queries and database relationships to ActiveRecord, but now I have a better grasp on it thanks to two sessions with two different people that helped me understand what was happening. My mentor, Brian Rose from PivotalLabs, helped me understand the entity relationship diagram of our current application by installing the <code>rails-erd</code> gem into our project and generating a PDF of our relationships for me. This was helpful to see, and his explanations helped immensely. I also sat with Jorge and we drew a few diagrams with carefully placed labels to map out a new many-to-many relationship I was creating, and now I think I have a good hold on the whole <code>belongs_to</code>, <code>has_many</code>, <code>is_one_of</code> structure.</p>

<p>I think that besides structuring models, views, and controllers well and understanding ActiveRecord, knowing all of the work that Rails can do might take a little time to learn and master &mdash; but overall I&rsquo;m enjoying working with it. My goals for this project are to get my feet wet with Rails, and start to understand where it can lift some of the burden of common tasks when building applications.</p>

    <link href="http://codeadventurer.com/2013/11/01/scraping-a-website"/>
    <updated>2013-11-01T09:12:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://codeadventurer.com/2013/11/01/scraping-a-website</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, we started a quick-turnaround project in Sinatra called <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/clone_wars.html">Clone Wars</a>. Our challenge was to pick one of five local businesses, build a CMS for their existing types of content, and then scrape their existing website into our database &mdash; all in three days. <!-- more --></p>

<p>On Monday, before the project started, we took a little time to research web scrapers as a class. Afterwards, we did a short <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/mechanize.html">tutorial</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize">Mechanize</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri">Nokogiri</a> gems, and started scraping different websites.</p>

<p>We were assigned our teams in the afternoon, and got to planning out our project. We got up to speed on what local business we wanted to choose (we went for the <a href="http://thebikedepot.org/">Bike Depot</a>), and started sketching out what the different types of content might look like. We set up our hours of availability as a team, and decided that we wanted to approach the entire project from an acceptance-test-first approach. It was our first time trying it, but we were all very interested in learning how to do it.</p>

<p>We then sat down with Elaine from <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a> (and prior gSchool student) to talk about user stories, acceptance tests, and <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/">PivotalTracker</a>. She gave us a lot of good insight on how to use the tool, and soon we started crafting our user stories for the project.</p>

<p>Once we got to the point where we felt we had flushed out the project requirements from a user story perspective, we started digging in. We set up our Sinatra app, and began by writing our first Capybara user test. We ran that first test… and it passed. That didn&rsquo;t make any sense &mdash; we had not set up any routes for the route that we had requested, and certainly did not have any views to display the content that the test requested!</p>

<p>This problem tripped us up for over an hour, when we discovered that in our Gemfile we had declared a test group, but we had not yet set our environment variables in our acceptance test. We also later discovered that looking for content as the first piece of an acceptance test is too many steps into the process &mdash; the first step would be to verify the response code. Finally on our way to a true failing test, we moved to the first piece of the error, and started working our way through the controller, the models, and the views. It was exciting to go through the process and actually successfully go from dummy data to a real database with real data in the matter of a few hours, and then repeat the process over and over again throughout the process.</p>

<p>From my perspective, our team worked incredibly well together. When one of us would get stuck, we&rsquo;d stop and explain what was happening, and why. We all paired (side note: what is the three-person equivalent of pairing? Triading?) throughout the length of the project, since we  had a small enough project that it was likely we might end up with merge conflicts otherwise.</p>

<p>Although we did not completely finish building the CMS in three days, we learned a lot about scraping, dynamic routing, serializing data into databases, and setting up different rack test groups. We had an awesome time trying the acceptace-test-first approach, and stuck together as a group to work through tough problems.</p>

<p>The differences between working in a two person versus a three person group weren&rsquo;t too obvious, since our project was so compact. I can definitely see where a four person group might split into two pairs that rotate, but with three people at different levels in the program, and with a small spec and a short timeframe, it seemed more appropriate to stick together and learn together.</p>

<p>If we had another week to work on Clone Wars, we&rsquo;d likely get our authorization working correctly, and work on integrating more functionality into the CMS &mdash; including the addition of news items, products for sale, and a volunteer database.</p>

<p>Overall, I was extremely satisfied with where we got with our project because I felt that we built it well, communicated with each other clearly, and have a solid foundation to build upon when we choose to revisit the project.</p>

<p>To see the project in action, you can visit George&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/Egogre/CloneWarz">GitHub repository</a>, clone the project, run <code>bundle</code>, then run <code>rackup</code> in your terminal, and visit your localhost for a peek at the project. At localhost/admin, you can view our CMS functionality. Make sure to take a look at our test suite, and run the tests by running the <code>rake</code> command in your terminal. Then marvel at the beautiful rainbow of passing tests!</p>
