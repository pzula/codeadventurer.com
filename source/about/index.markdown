### Who writes Code Adventurer?

Persa Zula started Code Adventurer in September 2013 to track her journey of learning Ruby and other code-related-stuff during and after [gSchool](http://gschool.it) in Denver, Colorado.

Persa has been a long time affectionado of HTML, CSS, and the web, and began making a living with web design since 2004. 

From 2004-2008, Persa attended the [Myers School of Art](http://art.uakron.edu) and earned a BFA in Graphic Design. After graduation, she spent the summer [WWOOFing](http://www.wwoof.net) on organic farms in Eastern Europe.

That fall, she accepted a position as a the Assistant Director of Web Communication at [The College of Wooster](http://wooster.edu), where she was instrumental in the massive task of moving the College's web presence away from single files uploaded to FTP to using a consistently-branded content management system.

After leaving the College of Wooster, Persa worked with many clients implementing, customizing, architecting and designing for CMS', primarily in PHP. She also spent her daytime hours working on organic farms and living in a yurt.

After a temporary position at the Ohio State Agricultural   Research & Development Center working on [Local Food Systems](http://localfoodsystems.org), Persa realized that she wanted to be more than a web designer. She wanted to become a full-stack web developer.

In September of 2012, Persa joined [Fathom](http://fathomdelivers.com) as a web developer, but spent a lot of her time building front-ends, working with many different CMS', and learning more about backend development using PHP.

After beginning to collaborate with [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org), Persa started a local brigade, [Code for Summit County](http://codeforsummitcounty.org), where fellow interested citizens began working with open data to build tools for the community. During her involvement with CfA, Persa began learning about Test Driven Development, Agile methodologies, and Ruby. 

Persa decided that her next step would be to learn more about TDD, Agile, and object oriented programming, but wanted to have a mentor along the way. She started exploring the option of going to a developer bootcamp, and decided to apply to gSchool. 

Code Adventurer is a collection of the journey she is on and the the things she learns along the way.
