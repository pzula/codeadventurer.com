56 days from now, 26 students from gSchool will be closing their laptops, saying their goodbyes, and getting ready to start their careers as software developers. Some of them will be staying in Denver, some will be joining past graduates of the program built by Jumpstart Lab, and others will be spreading out across the country, working at startups, consultancies, and corporations. Regardless of where they end up, the six months they spent together will never be forgotten. The shared wins and frustrations, the walking taco days and lunchtime dip parties, and plenty of post-project-deadline happy hours have built solid friendships that are sure to last the test of time.

Before that day comes, I still have work to do. As I'm reading Sandi Metz's book, [Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1388765519&sr=8-1&keywords=practical+object-oriented+design+in+ruby), I see that I can improve on the way I think about and execute the design of applications. I'm excited to work through the book, and apply the lessons in my projects. 

I'm also attending [CodeMash](http://codemash.org) this upcoming week and will begin looking for companies where I would make a good fit. I'm planning on returning to Ohio after graduation, and would like to see what sort of opportunities are available. Thanks to my instructors, I already have a few connections to meet with next week to discuss the job climate in the Cleveland area. I'm excited to talk to them and get to know other Rubyists in Ohio.

While I'm at CodeMash, I'll be missing work time on our current project, FeedEngine, which is all about APIs. I'll be doing my best to communicate with my group, and contribute where I can without interfering with the overall progress. It will be interesting to see if I can integrate lessons from the conference into the project as well. 

I'm also excited for our upcoming project focused on Service-Oriented Architecture, and finally our Mastery project. I received some fun hardware for Christmas and hope to use it in my final project to integrate my passion for technology with my passion for agriculture.

On a final note, my mentor, Matt Rogers, has been a tremendous resource. His help and understanding has really helped me grow as a developer. I applaud his ability to find relevant open-source work to help explain new concepts, or reinforce the ones I did not understand well. He has been diligent in following along the curriculum, asking me about the projects I am working on, and helping me understand where improvements can be made. I am very grateful for his time and his passion for mentoring. Without his help, I wouldn't have made as much learning progress in the last project as I had. Thank you, Matt!
