  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Keeping Things DRY Without Complecting: Table Inheritance</h3>

<p>When dealing with architecture, we find ourselves often dealing with concepts that are similar, yet just slightly different. In an effort to keep our code DRY, we might reach for an abstraction of these concepts all the way down to the data layer, in order to squeeze out more re-use within our codebase. But sometimes, our abstractions can lead to more complexity down the road. I&rsquo;d like to exploire this concept to see how an abstraction can morph over time, and what sort of decisions along the way can help an abstraction become easier or harder to use.</p>

<p>In the following example, we&rsquo;re going to assume that we are building a type of storage and logic system for content types in a small, hosted content-management system.</p>

<p>A content management system can have many kinds of content &mdash; including polls, blog posts, articles, events and so on. When a user opens an account, they are given a few of these default content types to use and customize.</p>

<p>As the engineer, we know that the types of content that our product offers to users will grow as our product grows, so we take a close look at what the content types have in common in order to try to tease out the similarities and build an abstraction that will allow us to easily add more content types in the future.</p>

<p>We find that each kind of content has a lot of the same ideas: we have sections, and each section can have instructions on what to use that section for, and each section can have many different input types.</p>

<p>There could be a problem, though: when a user modifies one of the content types by adding or removing parts, we can end up with data loss if they&rsquo;ve used that content type prior to the modification. By removing the field for author in the future, all prior posts that had an author entry will no longer have that data.</p>

<p>After some thought, we find a way around the problem of data loss. We will have
Templates for each type of content. The template is where a user can customize
how they want to be able to use this input form, from naming the template to
adding, editing and deleting fields and text within sections. Sections can also
be added, edited, or deleted. Some users might want to have a mood input field in
their blog posts. Others might want to have a &lsquo;Related Articles&rsquo; section
available when they add new acticles.  We also want to offer the ability to
bring back anything that has been removed from the template in the past, so each
template will have a &lsquo;Deleted&rsquo; section, where inputs and sections can be
retreived for later use.</p>

<p>However, the Template is only used for storing the structure of how the user
wants to interact with that type of content. When a user actually wants to
create a new piece of content, we will duplicate the structure of the Template
and turn it into a Document. This Document is a snapshot of the Template at that
point in time, and also contains the data entered by the user (such as an article or a blog post). If the Template for that content types gets modified
in the future, it will not affect a Document that has been created for that
content type, because they
are different objects and the data resides in different tables.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Building a keyboard can be likened to building a lightsaber. I set off on an adventure, found some plans, and somehow found the confidence to give it a try.</p>

<p>This is not an endeavor that happens without trepidation. When I first decided to spring for an Ergodox kit on <a href="http://massdrop.com">Massdrop</a>, I knew that I wouldn&rsquo;t be getting the parts in the mail for months. I figured I knew how to do a little soldering (thanks to the <a href="http://concoctory.com/">Concococtory&rsquo;s</a> beginner class), and it wouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal. But once the kit was on my front porch, months later, I started to doubt my abilities to complete this project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After setting up a SparkCore device (an internet-connected, Arduino-like device) to report the temperature and humidity in my greenhouse, I had one problem: persistance of the data. The SparkCore can transmit data via their SparkCloud API if you assign a variable for it in your Arduino code, and so I had a place where the data was constantly being transmitted. However, since the SparkCore itself has very limited memory capabilities, and since the only thing the SparkCloud itself does it provide a JSON-formatted API, I needed to figure out how to periodically ping the API and scoop up the data into a database.</p>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t seem like a job for the heft of Rails, so I started with Sinatra. My goals were to create something that others could reuse, improve upon, and deploy easily. Below I&rsquo;ll outline how to build your own API-slurping app from scratch. If you&rsquo;d rather just grab the code and hack on it, you can find it on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/pzula/greenhouse-watchman">https://github.com/pzula/greenhouse-watchman</a>.The evolution of the project is evident through the <a href="https://github.com/pzula/greenhouse-watchman/commits/master">commit log</a>, so you can see how I started building up from a few simple files to a more organized solution.</p>

<p>In this walkthrough, I&rsquo;ll be showing you how I built a simple Sinatra app with Redis and MongoDB to suck out data from and API and store it in a database for use in a data visualization project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today marks 100 days* since my first day as a software engineer at Hireology, and it&rsquo;s been an amazing experience.</p>

<p>A week before I officially became a software engineer, I packed up my apartment in Denver, shipped some bigger things home, packed the rest of my life in a suitcase and hopped back on a plane to Akron, Ohio.</p>

<p>I had done it &mdash; I had learned as much as I could in the six months that I attended gSchool with my fellow classmates, and leveled up my game in building things on the web. I learned test-driven development, service oriented architecture, modular design and so many more things. And now, I had a week to reorganize my life, and start my job as a remote engineer on a product team.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When making the decision to start a new career, you might find yourself a little lost. This can lead to a lot of online searches, reading articles and books on the subject at hand, and trying to understand quite a bit of contradictory advice. Instead of more online searches and questions posted to forums, the best investment you can make is in finding a mentor to help you through the maze. Throughout my journey, I&rsquo;ve come across great mentors, and have been starting to see patterns that emerge during a mentorship that make the relationship valuable and fulfilling for both parties.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>A little background</h2>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t new to computers five months ago when I started gSchool, a 6-month intensive &amp; immersive course in learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but I might as well had been.</p>

<p>I had spent the previous six years as a web designer who had a knack for getting things to work right. I had set up VPS servers, built up content management systems, and even began building lead generation systems from scratch in PHP with MySQL backends. I had heard acronyms like OO and MVC, but really didn&rsquo;t know how to program in an object-oriented way, or why models, views, and controllers even mattered. I came to gSchool thinking I would naturally be a top student, as I had been in other courses and programs. I quickly realized this wasn&rsquo;t the case, but it took me some time to come to terms with that. Looking back on the last five months I think I know why, and hope to be able to help others learning how to program understand what is happening if they come across similar frustrations.</p>
