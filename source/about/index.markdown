## Who writes Code Adventurer?

Hi! I'm Persa, and I'm a full-stack web developer with a curious mind. I like to write about my experiments and experiences as a programmer and share them with the world. If you want to learn more about me or my background, my [website](http://persazula.com) is a good source of information, as well as my [twitter](http://twitter.com/pzula). If you find any problems within my blog posts or tutorials, don't hesitate to reach out through the comments, Twitter, or my website to let me know.
