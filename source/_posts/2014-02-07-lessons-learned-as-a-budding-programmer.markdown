## A little background

I wasn't new to computers five months ago when I started gSchool, a 6-month intensive & immersive course in learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but I might as well had been.

I had spent the previous six years as a web designer who had a knack for getting things to work right. I had set up VPS servers, built up content management systems, and even began building lead generation systems from scratch in PHP with MySQL backends. I had heard acronymns like OO and MVC, but really didn't know how to program in an object-oriented way, or why models, views, and controllers even mattered. I came to gSchool thinking I would naturally be a top student, as I had been in other courses and programs. I quickly realized this wasn't the case, but it took me some time to come to terms with that. Looking back on the last five months I think I know why, and hope to be able to help others learning how to program understand what is happening if they come across similar frustrations.

## A different way of thinking

If you aren't coming from a background like engineering or law, it may be that you aren't used to thinking in a way that is conducive to writing computer programs. A quick check to see if you might be naturally inclined to breaking down a problem into it's smallest logical parts is to pull out a [LSAT logic game](http://www.griffonprep.com/logicgame.html) and spend some time trying to figure it out. Did you get the right answers? Then you might not have the same struggles I had. Throughout grade school, whenever I saw one of these word problems, I shuddered and usually froze. I never got the right answer. It wasn't until my interview with Katrina to join gSchool that I had finally understood how to solve these problems. I had always tried to solve these problems all in my head without writing anything down or drawing a chart.
