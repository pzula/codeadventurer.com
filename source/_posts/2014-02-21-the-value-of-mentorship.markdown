## I would be lying if I said that I got here on my own.

The most interesting questions I've gotten throughout my interview processes have been the ones regarding my journey to where I am today. One of the questions that sparked memories a decade deep was in regards to how I chosen my alma mater, and what had inspired me to pursue a degree in graphic design. Although I had been interested in building websites since I was 12, the thought of becoming a graphic designer had never crossed my mind as a pathway to web design. This had changed after I had met my best friend's girlfriend, [Beth Steffel](http://www.bethsteffel.com/), who was a senior at the University of Akron majoring in Graphic Design. Beth was easy to talk to, and we shared similar taste in art and design. I'd spend time at her apartment, peppering her with questions and getting miniture lessons in design. I had been experimenting with web design on my own, using my brother's educational Photoshop license and online tutorials, but I was inspired to learn more. I decided to follow in her footsteps
